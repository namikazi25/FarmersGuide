1,"Functional land cover scale for three insect pests with contrasting dispersal
strategies in a fragmented coffee-based landscape in Central Kenya","In the Eastern Africa highlands, the gradual transformation of natural ecosystems to smallholding coffee-based
agrosystems has resulted in more fragmented landscapes. Major pests of coffee find appropriate living condi-
tions leading to high infestation rates and the need for smallholder farmers to implement pest control measures.
This study aims to understand the influence of landscapes on the ecology of three major coffee pests: the coffee
berry borer (CBB), Hypothenemus hampei, and the Antestia bugs Antestiopsis thunbergii (ABT) and A. facetoides
(ABF). The study was conducted on a typical smallholder coffee-based landscape in central Kenya. The pest
abundance was assessed monthly for two years in a network of 30 coffee plots spread across the coffee agro-
ecological subzones (AEsZ), namely upper midland UM1 and UM2, and the transition zones between UM1
and UM2 and between UM2 and UM3, herein referred to as TZ1 and TZ2, respectively. Landscape metrics, viz.
patch density, Euclidean nearest neighbour distance, proximity index, contagion index, interspersion and
juxtaposition index were derived from a spatially explicit land cover map, based on 10 m Sentinel 2 data for nine
buffer zones of radius ranging from 50 m to 1000 m around each sampled plot. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was
used to establish the relationships between the observed pest abundances and landscape metrics, elevation, and
AEsZ. Landscape indicators achieved the highest correlation with the pest abundances within a 300 m radius
(Adjusted R2 > 0.5). Whereas beyond 300 m landscape scale, the predictor variables resulted in weak re-
lationships (Adjusted R2 < 0.5) between the pests abundance and landscape metrics. We noted a strong influence
of elevation and adjacency to cropland on Antestia bug populations. Specifically, ABF populations were nega-
tively correlated with low elevation, whereas ABT’s were positively correlated with high elevation zone. On the
other hand, CBB was strongly influenced by contiguous coffee patches, especially in UM1 and UM2. Therefore,
we recommend reducing connectivity between coffee patches for the management of CBB, whereas further
studies should be conducted to identify secondary hosts of Antestia bugs that should not be adjacent or within
coffee stands.","Ahmed et al., 2016). Furthermore, green berries are more attractive to
Antestia bugs than ripe berries, which emit volatiles that repel the bugs
(Njihia et al., 2018). In contrast, CBB is attracted to the red berries,
which are dominant during harvest seasons (November – December
(main crop) and March – April (fly crop)) (Jaramillo et al., 2006).
However, the low count of CBB observed during these periods in our
study is due to the fact that the Brocap traps are less attractive than red
berries available on trees. In the absence of red berries, the Brocap traps
become more attractive to flying female CBB, resulting in higher
catches. Thus, the observed monthly CBB count in our study is not the
true seasonal variation of the pest.
Pest abundance varied across the AEsZ, with notable differences in
plots sampled in TZ2 from those sampled in UM1 and UM2. TZ2 plots
predominantly consisted of ABF populations, unlike UM1, TZ1, and
UM2, which had high ABT and CBB populations. ABF’s preference for
higher temperatures limits its distribution to coffee of lower elevations
(Babin et al., 2018). In contrast, ABT’s preference for cooler environ-
ment is due to its limited thermal requirements for population growth,
ranging from 19◦ to 26◦C (Azrag et al., 2018, 2017). Our results,
therefore, confirm those of previous studies that showed ABT prefers the
highest elevations (1500–2100 m asl), where temperatures are appro-
priate for its development, survival, and reproduction (Azrag et al.,
2017, 2018; Babin et al., 2018). On the other hand, CBB seems to sup-
port a larger range of temperatures that leads to a wider distribution
over the study area (Jaramillo et al., 2009).
Furthermore, the high variation in pest abundance within the same
AEsZ (especially CBB in UM1 and ABT in TZ1) indicates that other
factors apart from elevation, such as agronomic practices, shade man-
agement, or natural enemies, influence the variability of the pest. For
example, ABT populations are abundant in bushy coffee trees and
shaded coffee plantations (Kirkpatrick, 1937). As one of the agronomic
practices, farmers use pruning to improve coffee yield and manage the
pest. Good pruning of coffee trees exposes Antestia bugs to extreme
temperatures that can be lethal, especially for the immature stages
(Azrag et al., 2018). These could be one of the reasons that explain the
variations in ABT population for plots located in the same zone. Equally,
Jaramillo et al. (2006) recorded a higher CBB population in full-sun
coffee than those under the shade, yet sampling was done in the same
coffee estate. Often, the microclimate in shaded coffee varies from that
in non-shade coffee. For instance, Siles et al. (2010) noted that Inga
densiflora, a commonly used shade tree in Costa Rica, reduced the
maximum coffee leaf temperature by 5 ◦C and increased the minimum
temperature at night by 0.5 ◦C when compared to the non-shade system.
Consequently, pest infestation levels, even in plots located within the
same elevation, can vary due to variation in microclimatic conditions.
We also sought to understand which spatial patterning of LULC types
and landscape scale significantly influenced the observed pest pop-
ulations. Similar studies have been conducted on bee pollinators (Sat-
urni et al., 2016), bird species (Tscharntke et al., 2008), and parasitoids
(Liu et al., 2016) due to the recognition of the importance of landscape
ecology in supporting or limiting viable species communities. Our re-
sults showed that the functional landscape scale for the observed pests
was up to 300 m and we relate this spatial limit to their dispersal ca-
pacity, which is influenced by their body size and their foraging pref-
erences (Barbaro and Van Halder, 2009b). Individually, CBB was
significant at 100 m, while Antestia bugs were significant at 200 m
(ABF) and 300 m (ABT). CBB are small-bodied insects with limited
dispersal capacity unlike Antestia bugs, which are about four times
bigger in body size than CBB with long flight ranges (Waller et al.,
2007). Consequently, a connected landscape with coffee as the main
cover is vital for survival of CBB (Gil et al., 2015). The significance of the
PROX index from our results reinforce the importance of landscape
connectivity for CBB, especially in UM1 and UM2, which are the central
coffee growing subzones in the study area.
Interestingly, our results also noted that ABT correlated to a larger
landscape scale than ABF. It is thought that the body size between the
two species differ with ABF having a smaller body size than ABT, which
limits its dispersal capacity (R. Babin, Personal Communication). The
ease of mobility allows the ABF population in our study area to thrive in
TZ2 where coffee is more interspersed in a matrix of cropland, allowing
the pest to move from one patch to the other for forage (Babin et al.,
2018). Additionally, Antestia bugs have been shown to feed on

secondary wild host plants (Babin et al., 2018). This underscores the
significance of IJI metric to Antestia bugs populations, which could
suggest that grasslands and croplands could be providing alternative
host plants.
This study concludes that the landscape ecology of the study area
influences the population dynamics of the two species of Antestia bugs
and CBB. Thus, land use planning at landscape scale should be consid-
ered when establishing coffee plots with the awareness of the neigh-
bouring patch types, especially within a radius of 300 m (Karungi et al.,
2015). For CBB, homogenized landscapes should be disrupted by
introducing new patches of natural vegetation such as edge trees, which
will also limit the dispersal of Antestia bugs (Avelino et al., 2012). In the
lower AEsZ, where croplands form the matrix, further studies should be
conducted to evaluate which cover types host the preferred secondary
host plant of Antestia bugs, to be discouraged from neighbouring coffee
patches. Finally, policy frameworks such as the agri-environment
schemes in Europe should be formulated to guide farmers on land-
scape management that preserve biodiversity, while reducing the
negative impacts of excessive use of pesticides to control pests (Kleijn
and Sutherland, 2003). This can be achieved by compensating farmers
for conservation by promoting speciality markets that have better coffee
prices.", Kenya, Coffee, Agrosystem, Smallholder agriculture, Eastern Africa highlands,The specific crop studied is **coffee**.,"Here are the plant-insect relationships observed in the study:

1. **Antestia bugs and their secondary host plants**: Antestia bugs (ABF and ABT) feed on secondary wild host plants, which suggests that grasslands and croplands can provide alternative host plants for these insects.
2. **Coffee as a main cover for CBB survival**: Coffee is essential for the survival of CBB, indicating a strong relationship between coffee plants and CBB populations.
3. **No specific plant-insect relationships mentioned for CBB**: The study does not mention any specific plant-insect relationships for CBB other than its dependence on coffee as a main cover.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on these points!","Here are the best ways to protect crops based on this study:

1. **Disrupt homogenized landscapes**: Introduce new patches of natural vegetation, such as edge trees, to limit the dispersal of pests like Antestia bugs and CBB.
2. **Maintain landscape connectivity for CBB**: Ensure a connected landscape with coffee as the main cover, while introducing patches of natural vegetation to disrupt their dispersal.
3. **Evaluate secondary host plants**: Conduct further studies in lower AEsZ areas where croplands form the matrix, to identify which cover types host the preferred secondary host plant of Antestia bugs and discourage them from neighbouring coffee patches.
4. **Promote landscape management for biodiversity**: Formulate policy frameworks that guide farmers on landscape management, such as agri-environment schemes in Europe, to preserve biodiversity and reduce pesticide use.

* Recommendations for protecting crops from pests like CBB and Antestia bugs at the farm level.",Not stated.,"The pests mentioned in the study are:

* Antestia bugs (two species)
* Coffee Berry Borer (CBB)

These pests are considered significant threats to coffee crops.

As for which one is particularly ""dangerous"", it's not explicitly stated in the text, but the Coffee Berry Borer (CBB) seems to be a more significant problem, especially considering its influence on landscape management and land use planning.","Here are the answers:

case study of Gayo Arabica coffee in Indonesia","Biodiversity is defined as the variety of life encompassing the ‘existing’ variations at
all level, starting from the tiny genes within a species up to a broader sense consisted of
habitats within ecosystem. It is urgently needed as long as human is still exist on this earth.
Therefore, its proper utilization and correct application of biodiversity bring great advantage
in tangible and non-tangible benefits. Indonesia is known as the third largest biodiversity
hotspots; both its flora and fauna. It has also tremendous diverse ecosystems extended from
west to east; with amplitude of variation ranging from humid tropical rain forests until a
very dry savannah type at the eastern part of Nusa Tenggara. Furthermore, Indonesia is also
known as the fourth world highest producer of coffee; with a total production 11,49 million
kg in 2016-2017. The Gayo highlands on the northern tip of Sumatra are known as the
major production of arabica coffee. There, up to ten varieties of commercial arabica coffee
are planted on the highlands. The origin of coffee is in Ethiopia, which is believed as the
center of the commercial coffee species in this world: C. arabica and C. canephora. The
objective of this paper is to review the status of coffee, esp. the arabica one from various
perspectives, ranging from the biology, history of coffee, the processing of coffee (wet vs.
dry methods), and how the component of natural biodiversity can be applied in order to
enhance the coffee production, particularly on the Gayo highlands.","Coffee is the second most drinking liquid after water and drinking
coffee has been served as a life style for urban and modern people.

**Wasp species richness was higher in coffee plantations, but wasps were more abundant in forest remnants. Dominant wasp species were found in both habitats, suggesting that plant-insect relationships vary between forest remnants and coffee plantations. However, the study does not provide specific information on how these relationships affect pollination or pest control.**","Based on this study, here's what I can tell you about protecting crops:

* **Maintain forest cover**: The study suggests that increasing forest cover in the surrounding landscape leads to increased spillover of beneficial insects between forest remnants and coffee plantations. Therefore, conserving and restoring forests near coffee farmlands may help protect crops.
* **Incorporate forest conservation into agro-environmental schemes**: The study recommends incorporating forest conservation into agro-environmental schemes designed to improve the provision of ecosystem services within coffee farmlands.
* **Manage pesticide usage**: The study found that pesticide usage did not affect wasp dissimilarities between forest remnants and coffee plantations. However, it's worth noting that reducing or eliminating pesticide use may still be beneficial for protecting crops in other ways (e.g., by preserving beneficial insects).

4,"Positive effect of bee pollination on coffee production is highly contingent of irrigation in coffee agroforestry landscape of Kodagu, southern India","Agricultural productivity, particularly in the tropics, is at least partially dependent upon natural ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, and water and soil conservation. While empirical studies have shown that the productivity of coffee is enhanced by insect pollination, rarely have management practices been included in such analyses. This omission means that the value of pollination services cannot be set within the range of management interventions available to farmers. Without this broader context, it is difficult to evaluate how farmers might respond to calls for managing land to secure pollination services. In Kodagu, a major coffee-growing region in southern India, we investigated the contribution that bee pollination makes to coffee production in the context of fertilization, irrigation and shade management practices as well as environmental variables. We monitored coffee production on 10 coffee bushes from flowering to harvest in 123 sites located at least 1 km from one another. In each of these sites, bee observations were carried out when coffee flowered. Data on shade level and shade tree density were collected through field surveys, and management practices recorded through interviews with planters. Our results show that even taking into account management decisions, bee abundance contributes more to coffee production in terms of number of berries harvested than other management practices, such as NPK fertilisation. Bee abundance, however, is highly contingent upon management actions, particularly irrigation, rather than the nature of the surrounding habitat matrix. Indeed, bee abundance at any one site was mainly driven by irrigation, which triggered asynchronous flowering and concentrated bee foraging. Raising awareness among coffee growers of the role of asynchronously irrigating can potentially contribute to improve quantitatively and qualitatively coffee production.","Agricultural productivity, particularly in the tropics, is at least partially dependent upon natural ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, and water and soil conservation.

5,"Tropical Forest Fragments Enhance Pollinator Activity
in Nearby Coffee Crops","Crop pollination by wild bees is an ecosystem service of enormous value, but it is under increas-
ing threat from agricultural intensification. As with many ecosystem services, the mechanisms, scales, and
species through which crop pollination is provided are too poorly understood to inform land-use decisions. I
investigated the role of tropical forest remnants as sources of pollinators to surrounding coffee crops in Costa
Rica. In 2001 and 2002 I observed bee activity and pollen deposition rates at coffee flowers along distance
gradients from two fragments and one narrow riparian strip of forest. Eleven eusocial species were the most
common visitors: 10 species of native meliponines and the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera (hereafter
Apis). Bee richness, overall visitation rate, and pollen deposition rate were all significantly higher in sites
within approximately 100 m of forest fragments than in sites farther away (maximum distance of 1.6 km).
Apis visitation rates were constant across the distance gradient, however, and Apis accounted for >90% of all
floral visits in distant sites. The gradient from the riparian strip showed a similar drop in bee species richness
with distance, but visitation rates were uniformly low along the gradient. Throughout the study area, Apis
abundances declined sharply from 2001 to 2002, reducing visitation rates by over 50% in distant sites (where
Apis was almost the only pollinator). In near sites, however, overall visitation rates dropped only 9% because
native species almost entirely compensated for the Apis decline. Forest fragments (more so than the riparian
strip) thus provided nearby coffee with a diversity of bees that increased both the amount and stability of
pollination services by reducing dependence on a single introduced pollinator. Exploring the economic links
between forest preservation and coffee cultivation may help align the goals of conservation and agriculture
within many regions of global conservation priority.","These results suggest that forest remnants enhance pol-
linator activity in surrounding agricultural fields. Coffee
plants within 100 m of forest received more visits by more
bee species and experienced higher pollen-deposition
rates than plants at greater distances (Fig. 2). These in-
creases were from native bees, which were primarily in
sites nearest the forest patches. Plants farther than 300 m
from forest appeared to rely almost exclusively on intro-
duced Apis for pollination (Table 2).
In addition to augmenting pollinator activity in a single
year, bee diversity near forest appeared to help stabilize
levels of pollinator activity over time. The sharp decline
in Apis from 2001 to 2002 greatly reduced overall visita-
tion rates in sites far from forest (800 m), whereas in sites
near forest, native species almost entirely compensated
for this decline (Fig. 3). Large fluctuations in insect popu-
lations are common, including those of important pollina-
tors ( Wolda 1978; Roubik 2001). Bee diversity therefore
may stabilize pollination services over time through an
averaging effect, whereby fluctuations in the abundance

of one population are compensated for by asynchronous
dynamics of others (McCann 2000).
Riparian strips of forest are often preserved in agricul-
tural landscapes either by law or by default in areas too
steep or flood-prone for cultivation (de Lima & Gascon
1999). Because they are more common than large for-
est remnants and less threatened by competing land use,
these strips potentially represent a convenient and inex-
pensive source of pollination (and other) services. In my
study, however, the riparian strip of forest did not en-
hance pollinator activity at nearby coffee plants to nearly
the same degree as the larger forest patches did (Fig. 4).
Although the riparian strip harbored bee richness similar
to that of the south forest patch, these species occurred at
lower abundances (data not shown); therefore, visitation
rates to coffee flowers were not elevated near the riparian
strip as they were near the forest patch. The riparian strip
clearly contained a diversity of flowering tree species and
potential nesting sites (personal observation). Reduced
bee abundances there may reflect smaller area or edge
effects (e.g., a hotter, dryer microclimate) that reduce its
suitability for nesting (Bierregaard et al. 2001).
Although not all bees depend on natural habitats (Mich-
ener 2000), both meliponines and Apis are thought to re-
quire forest habitats for two reasons. First, they prefer to
nest in tree cavities ( Wille & Michener 1973; Griswold
et al. 1995), which are more available in forest than in
the managed shade trees on this farm. Second, the diver-
sity of plants (and flowering phenologies) in forests likely
provides year-round floral resources for these continually
active social species (Roubik 1989; Allen-Wardell et al.
1998; Kevan 1999).
Among native species, the Meliponini were the most
common visitors to coffee. The eusocial behavior of these
species, and thus their ability to recruit nestmates quickly
to resources, may explain their dominance among natives
on this flush-flowering crop (Heard 1999). The restriction
of the Meliponini to sites nearest coffee is consistent with
published studies of their flight ranges. Effective foraging
ranges for the majority of meliponines are typically 100–
400 m (reviewed in Heard 1999), although maximum ob-
served flights range from 1 to 2 km (e.g., Roubik & Aluja
1983). Given the abundance of coffee flowers open simul-
taneously throughout the farm, one would expect forag-
ing radii during a florea to be smaller than the maxima
observed in native habitats.
If native species are found primarily near forest, why
were Apis workers equally abundant at all distance classes
(Table 2)? This result suggests that Apis have either larger
foraging distances, less specific nesting preferences, or
both. Apis are known to forage over greater distances
than the native bees found in this study, often ranging
to several kilometers (Seeley 1985). In addition, man-
agers destroy Apis nests within Finca Santa Fe because
these Africanized “killer bees” are dangerous to person-
nel (farm manager M. Jimenez, personal communication).
Together, these two points suggest that Apis individuals I
observed, even in the study sites farthest from forest, were
from nests in surrounding forest patches. Mark-recapture
studies (Roubik 1999) and more careful surveys for nests
within the farm may help clarify this issue.
Few of the measured environmental factors differed
among sample sites in either year. Furthermore, those
variables that showed differences did not vary in ways
that would appear to influence the bee activity results.
For example, although the mean time of sampling dif-
fered significantly between transects in 2001, bee activity
did not. In addition, the significant distance × source in-
teraction for wind strength and weeds in 2002 (data not
shown) did not reflect the pattern of bee visitation rates
shown in Fig. 4b", Costa Rica, Coffee, Tropical Forest, Intensive Agriculture," Mesoamerica (implied, since Costa Rica is located in this region)",The specific crop studied is coffee.,"Here's what I found:

1. **Native bees prefer plants near forest fragments**: Native bee species, especially Meliponini, were more abundant and visited coffee flowers more frequently when the plants were close to forest fragments.

2. **Introduced honeybees (Apis) can travel far from forest habitats**: Apis workers were equally abundant at all distance classes, suggesting they have larger foraging distances or less specific nesting preferences.

3. **Forest remnants provide a diverse range of pollinators**: The study found that forest fragments provided a more diverse range of pollinators compared to riparian strips or areas far from forest habitats.

4. **Native bees compensate for fluctuations in Apis populations**: When Apis populations declined, native bee species almost entirely compensated for this decline, suggesting that bee diversity can stabilize pollination services over time through an ""averaging effect"".","**Not Stated**

The study focuses on the impact of tropical forest fragments on pollinator activity and suggests that preserving these fragments can enhance pollination services for nearby coffee crops. However, it does not provide specific recommendations for protecting crops based on its findings.

To address your question in a more constructive way:

While the study highlights the importance of preserving tropical forest fragments to support native bee populations and improve crop pollination, it leaves open the following questions regarding effective conservation strategies:

* How can agricultural landscapes be designed or managed to incorporate more forest remnants?
* What are the minimum sizes or configurations of forest fragments required to effectively support pollinator activity?
* Can riparian strips of forest, while less effective than larger patches, still contribute to pollination services if properly maintained?

These questions and others are not addressed in the study.","Here is the answer:

**Beneficial insect-plant interactions observed in this study:**

* Tropical forest fragments enhance pollinator activity in nearby coffee crops.
* Native bees, particularly meliponines and Apis mellifera (honeybees), visit coffee flowers and contribute to pollination.
* Bee diversity near forest patches stabilizes levels of pollinator activity over time by compensating for fluctuations in individual species populations.
* Forest fragments provide a source of pollinators that increase the amount and stability of pollination services.",Not stated.,"Here are the natural practices suggested by the paper:

1. **Preservation of forest fragments**: The study shows that preserving large forest patches near coffee crops can increase pollinator activity and stability of pollination services.
2. **Maintenance of riparian strips**: Although the study found that riparian strips were less effective in enhancing pollinator activity, they are still considered a convenient and inexpensive way to provide pollination services.
3. **Protection of natural habitats for bees**: The paper suggests that preserving natural habitats, such as forests with tree cavities, is essential for maintaining bee populations.

Not stated:

* Use of natural pest control methods or biological control
* Implementation of agroecology practices (e.g., polyculture, crop rotation)
* Maintenance of ecosystem services through conservation efforts

However, the paper does suggest that exploring economic links between forest preservation and coffee cultivation could help align conservation and agriculture goals.",corresponding_author@gmail.com
6,"The Effect of Shade Trees in the Coffee Ecosystem to the Population
and Diurnal Activity of Insect Pollinators","Insect pollinators is one of the important factors in the cross-pollination of coffee flowers, which affects the coffee fruit set. However, there is still a limited understanding of how shade trees in the coffee ecosystem affect insect pollinators. The purpose of this study was to obtain information on the effect of climate variations at different shading levels in the coffee ecosystem to the population and  diurnal  activity  of  insect  pollinators.  The  shade  levels  are  categorized  in  three  ways,  namely  high  shade,  low  shade,  and  open shade. The observation was conducted at the time when the flower blooms with sample units a flower in two coffee branches. Insect pollinators  that  show  feeding  behavior  in  coffee  flowers  were  recorded  in  the  morning,  while  the  diurnal  activity  of  each  species pollinator was observed in the  morning,  midday, and afternoon. The study showed five species of insects belonging to three families and two orders, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera that showed feeding behavior on coffee flowers. Apis cerana and Apis mellifera were the  dominant  pollinators  of  coffee  flowers.  The  difference  in  shade  levels  did  not  affect  pollinator  species  to  visit  coffee  flowers,  but their population tends to decrease in the open shade, except Apis cerana. The peak of diurnal activity of insect pollinator recorded in the morning decreased at midday and showed an increase slightly in the afternoon until the end of the diurnal activity. An increase of temperature may significantly decrease the number of pollinators that visit coffee flowers, while humidity and light intensity showed no significant effect.",".CONCLUSIONThe   differences   of   shade   conditions   in   the   coffee ecosystem  did  not  affect  species  of  insect  pollinators  that visit  coffee  flowers,  but  the  population  tends  to  decrease  in the   more   open   shade.   Honey   bees, A.   cerana,   and A. mellifera  are  the  dominant  species  in  all  shade  conditions. The study also recorded that the insect pollinator population decreased significantly by increasing temperatures, while the effects  of  relative  humidity  and  light  intensity  were  not significant. The shade trees may contribute to increasing the population  of  insect  pollinators  by  establishing  the  climate factors in the coffee ecosystem. The diurnal activity of insect pollinators  in  coffee  flowers  showed  an  increase  quickly  in the   morning,   decreases   rapidly   at   midday,   and   slightly increases  in  the  afternoon  until  the  end  of  the  activity.  The shade  trees  in  the  coffee  ecosystem  play  important  roles  in encouraging the abundance and the diurnal activity of insect pollinators;  thus,  the  existence  in  the  coffee  production system  is  needed.  Management  strategies  related  to  the existence  of  shade  trees  in  the  coffee  ecosystem  are  also  an important  part  in  anticipating  climate  change  in  the  future coffee production system", Not stated, Coffee, Agroecosystem (coffee ecosystem), Shade-grown agriculture," Not stated (or it could be assumed that the study was made in a region with tropical climate suitable for coffee production, but it's not explicitly mentioned)",The specific crop studied is Coffee.,"The study observed that five species of insects belonging to three families and two orders (Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera) showed feeding behavior on coffee flowers, indicating a positive relationship between the plants (coffee flowers) and the insect pollinators.","Based on this study, here's a simple and understandable conclusion:

**Best Ways to Protect Crop:**

1. **Maintain shade trees**: Shade trees can increase the population of insect pollinators, which is essential for cross-pollination and coffee fruit set.
2. **Control temperature**: Avoid extreme temperatures that can decrease the number of pollinators visiting coffee flowers.
3. **Promote diverse ecosystem**: Encourage a diverse ecosystem with various plant species to attract different types of pollinators.

**Not Stated:**

* Specific techniques for managing or conserving shade trees
* Details on how to anticipate climate change in coffee production systems","The study observes that:

* Insect pollinators show feeding behavior on coffee flowers.
* The presence of shade trees does not affect the species of insect pollinators visiting coffee flowers, but their population tends to decrease in open shade conditions.

However, specific beneficial insect-plant interactions are not explicitly stated in the text.",Not stated.,"The natural practice suggested in the paper is:

* Maintaining shade trees in the coffee ecosystem.

This is because the study found that shade trees contribute to increasing the population of insect pollinators, encourage their abundance, and affect their diurnal activity. The researchers conclude that maintaining shade trees is important for anticipating climate change in future coffee production systems.",corresponding_author@gmail.com
